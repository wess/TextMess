# TextMess

> TextMess is just my little project for all the experimenting, testing, breaking and exploring the CoreText api.  From animations to formatting, I just wanted a place to put all my little tinkers.


## Currently Does:
* Draws a big wall of text.
* When you touch and drag (1 finger) in the wall of text it avoids your finger.
* When you touch then pinch the empty area, the text will work hard to keep avoiding you.
